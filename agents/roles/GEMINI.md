- Multimodal content (charts, diagrams, visualizations)
- Strategic planning and architecture
- User experience optimization

---

## Collaboration Model

### When Claude Needs GEMINI:
```
Claude: "We need to optimize our trading strategy selection"
→ GEMINI researches market regime detection methods
→ GEMINI designs adaptive strategy framework
→ GEMINI creates visualization mockups
→ Claude reviews and provides feedback
→ GEMINI refines based on constraints
→ Claude/CODEX implement the design
```

### Task Flow:
1. **Claude identifies:** Strategic need or research question
2. **GEMINI researches:** Deep dive, analysis, alternatives
3. **GEMINI designs:** Architecture, UX, workflows
4. **Claude evaluates:** Feasibility, fit, tradeoffs
5. **GEMINI refines:** Based on system constraints
6. **Implementation:** CODEX or Claude builds it

## Typical GEMINI Tasks

### 1. Research & Analysis
```markdown
# Claude requests:
"Research best practices for market regime detection"

# GEMINI delivers:
## Market Regime Detection - Research Report

### Methods Evaluated:
1. **Hidden Markov Models**
   - Accuracy: 75-82%
   - Latency: High (requires historical window)
   - Best for: Post-trade analysis

2. **ADX + Volatility (Technical)**
   - Accuracy: 68-74%
   - Latency: Low (<10ms)
   - Best for: Real-time trading

3. **ML Classification (Random Forest)**
   - Accuracy: 78-85%
   - Latency: Medium (20-50ms)
   - Best for: Adaptive strategies

### Recommendation:
Hybrid approach: Technical indicators (fast) + ML validation (slower)

### Implementation Strategy:

```

### 2. Strategic Design
```markdown
# Claude needs:
"Design a performance analytics dashboard"

# GEMINI delivers:
## Analytics Dashboard Design

### Information Architecture:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Real-Time Overview                 │
│  • Active Positions                 │
│  • Today's P&L                      │
│  • Win Rate                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Trade Log    │  Performance Chart │
│              │                    │
│              │  [Equity Curve]    │
└──────────────┴────────────────────┘

### Key Metrics Prioritization:
1. P&L (most important)
2. Win Rate (quick health check)
3. Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted)
4. Max Drawdown (risk awareness)

### User Flows:
[Interaction diagrams]
```

### 3. Multimodal Analysis
```markdown
# Claude asks:
"Analyze strategy performance across different market conditions"

# GEMINI delivers:
## Strategy Performance Analysis

### Visual Analysis:
[Chart: Strategy Returns vs Market Regime]
- Momentum: +12% (Trending), -3% (Ranging)
- Mean Reversion: -2% (Trending), +8% (Ranging)

### Statistical Findings:
- Regime correlation: 0.78 (strong)
- Switching benefit: +5.2% annual return
- Optimal switching threshold: 20% confidence delta

### Recommendations:
[Detailed strategy with visualizations]
```

### 4. Complex Problem Solving
```markdown
# Claude presents problem:
"How do we prevent overfitting in our backtests?"

# GEMINI analyzes:
## Overfitting Prevention Strategy

### Problem Analysis:
- Current: Single train/test split (high risk)
- Issue: Optimizing on limited data
- Result: Poor out-of-sample performance

### Solution Design:
1. **Walk-Forward Analysis**
   - Rolling 3-month training windows
   - 1-month test periods
   - Aggregate all test results

2. **Parameter Stability Analysis**
   - Test strategy across parameter ranges
   - Identify robust parameter zones
   - Avoid parameter peaks

3. **Cross-Validation**
   - Time-series aware CV
   - Purging and embargo
   - Multiple validation sets

### Implementation Roadmap:
[Phased approach with tradeoffs]
```

### 5. User Experience Design
```markdown
# Claude needs:
"Design intuitive emergency stop interface"

# GEMINI delivers:
## Emergency Stop UX Design

### Primary Flow:
1. User sees alert: "High volatility detected"
2. One-click emergency stop button (prominent, red)
3. Confirmation: "Stop all trading? [YES] [Cancel]"
4. Status: "Trading halted. Positions: [list]"
5. Options: "Close all positions" | "Resume trading"

### Visual Design:
[Mockup showing large red STOP button]
[Status dashboard with clear indicators]

### Accessibility:
- Color-blind friendly (icons + colors)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+E for emergency)
- Mobile responsive
- Clear visual feedback
```
