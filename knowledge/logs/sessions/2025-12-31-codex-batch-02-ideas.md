# Codex Batch 02 Ideas (2025-12-31)
Scope:
- Finish in-flight workflow/tooling items.
- Follow ganzer plan.txt order after Block 1.

Plan (ordered):
- Block 1 remainder: #353, #341, #347, #346.
- Block 2: #338, #337, #336, #335, #330, #321, #147, #170, #171, #159.
- Block 3: #162, #158, #166, #167, #168, #330, #164, #156, #155, #151.
- Block 4: #230, #229, #224, #172, #160, #165, #171, #173, #169, #328.
- Block 5: #327, #326, #145, #99, #328, #169, #160, #173, #325, #323.
- Block 6: #203, #200, #198, #199, #197, #193, #194, #195, #196, #333.

Notes:
- Duplicates across blocks (e.g., #330, #169, #171, #328, #160) should stay on the existing issue/branch only.
- #353 requires GitHub branch protection settings + evidence; likely doc + manual proof.
- #341 already has a branch; verify evidence and next step.
- #347 logging policy branch exists; confirm current docs/compose and propose deltas before changes.
- #346 is an epic; likely update status + link to completed branches.
- Follow-ups outside ganzer plan.txt: #410, #411, #412.
