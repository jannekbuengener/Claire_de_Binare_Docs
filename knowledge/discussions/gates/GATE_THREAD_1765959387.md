# 🚨 Human Review Gate: BSDE vs. Stochastic Control

**Thread ID:** THREAD_1765959387
**Proposal:** BSDE vs. Stochastic Control Framework Selection
**Triggered:** 2025-12-17T14:23:07Z
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED (PROCEED)

---

## Gate Trigger Reasons

1. ✅ **Explicit Flag:** `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` in Claude output
2. ✅ **Strategic Keywords:** "High organizational impact" detected

**Why This Requires Human Decision:**

- Strategic technical direction affecting Q1/Q2 2025 deliverables
- Team hiring implications (0-1 vs. 2-3 new hires)
- Budget allocation between HJB baseline and BSDE research track
- Long-term maintainability and expertise requirements

---

## Pipeline Summary

**Agents Executed:** Claude (Quick preset)
**Overall Confidence:** 77% (Good, but not excellent)
**Quality Verdict:** GOOD

**Agent Recommendation:**
> **Hybrid approach** - HJB baseline + BSDE research track

**Key Trade-off:**
- HJB: Production-ready, mature ecosystem, limited to d ≤ 10
- BSDE: Handles high dimensions (d > 20), but immature tooling + 2-3x dev time
- Hybrid: De-risks decision, provides staged rollout with fallback

---

## Critical Decision Points

### 1. Dimensionality Uncertainty (±20% confidence)

**Unknown:** What's the actual dimensionality of your production risk model?

**Impact:** If d ≤ 10, HJB dominates. If d > 30, BSDE is required.

**Resolution:** Week 1-2 dimensionality audit (map risk components → state variables)

### 2. Team Capacity (±15% confidence)

**Unknown:** Can your team maintain BSDE neural solvers?

**Requirements:**
- HJB: 0-1 PDE expert
- BSDE: 1-2 ML engineers + 1 stochastic calculus expert + 6-12 months ramp-up

**Resolution:** Interview team, assess ML/PDE comfort levels

### 3. Timeline Pressure

**Constraint:** Q1 2025 decision, Q2 2025 prototyping

**Risk:** Pure BSDE approach has 40% chance of solver convergence issues in production

**Mitigation:** Hybrid approach delivers working HJB baseline in Q1, optional BSDE in Q2

---

## Recommended Action (Claude Analysis)

**✅ PROCEED** with staged approach:

**Phase 1 (Q1 2025):** Dimensionality audit + prototype shootout
- Week 1-2: Map state variables, identify decompositions
- Week 3-4: Implement toy problem in both frameworks (3D Black-Scholes)
- Week 5-6: Review results, make architecture decision

**Phase 2 (Q2 2025):** Production implementation
- Build HJB baseline (4 weeks)
- Validate on historical data (2 weeks)
- Deploy to shadow mode (2 weeks)
- (Optional) Add BSDE layer in parallel

**Phase 3 (Q3 2025):** Dynamic routing
- Route problems based on dimensionality
- HJB for real-time (low latency)
- BSDE for batch optimization (high accuracy)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| BSDE solver doesn't converge in production | 40% | High | Hybrid with HJB fallback |
| HJB too slow for real-time | 30% | Medium | Pre-compute + interpolate |
| Team can't maintain BSDE | 50% | High | External consulting, docs |
| Dimensionality higher than expected | 20% | Critical | Early audit to validate d |

**Overall Risk:** Medium-High for pure BSDE, Low-Medium for hybrid

## Human Decision Required

**Please review the full discussion thread and choose:**

### ✅ PROCEED
Accept hybrid approach recommendation. Create GitHub issue with:
- [ ] Dimensionality audit action items (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Prototype shootout tasks (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Architecture decision meeting (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Assigned: Quantitative Modeling Team
- [ ] Timeline: Q1 2025

### 🔄 REVISE
Request additional analysis. Specify what's missing:
- [ ] More detailed cost/benefit analysis?
- [ ] Alternative frameworks (e.g., Monte Carlo methods)?
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis on dimensionality assumptions?
- [ ] External expert consultation needed?

### ❌ REJECT
Do not proceed with this approach. Document rationale:
- [ ] Timeline too aggressive?
- [ ] Budget constraints?
- [ ] Different strategic direction?
- [ ] Insufficient team capacity?

## Decision Record

**Decision:** [X] PROCEED

**Decided By:** Project Lead

**Date:** 2025-12-17

**Rationale:**

Hybrid approach provides best risk/reward balance. Dimensionality audit and
prototype shootout are concrete, low-risk first steps that will resolve key
uncertainties before major commitment.

**Next Actions (if PROCEED):**

- [ ] Create GitHub issue from thread
- [ ] Assign to Quantitative Modeling Team
- [ ] Schedule Week 1 dimensionality audit kickoff
- [ ] Budget approval for potential BSDE hiring (Q2)

**Next Actions (if REVISE):**

- [ ] Specify additional analysis required
- [ ] Re-run pipeline with updated prompt
- [ ] Schedule follow-up review

**Next Actions (if REJECT):**

- [ ] Archive thread with rationale
- [ ] Update proposal with REJECTED status
- [ ] Document lessons learned
