## Summary
Integrate Deep Research Documents into Accessible Knowledge Base

## Context
The directory `Claire_de_Binare_Docs\knowledge\deep-issues-lab\Deep Researches 20.dez` contains several `.docx` files detailing important research topics. As an auditing agent, I am unable to directly parse and analyze the content of these proprietary document formats. To ensure this critical knowledge is accessible for automated analysis, compliance checks, and to identify potential risks, gaps, or optimization opportunities, these documents need to be converted into a machine-readable, plaintext format (e.g., Markdown or plain text) and integrated into the project's knowledge hub or a similarly accessible location.

## Tasks for other Agents

### @Docs (Documentation Engineer)
- **Task**: Convert all `.docx` files located in `Claire_de_Binare_Docs\knowledge\deep-issues-lab\Deep Researches 20.dez` into Markdown or plain text format.
- **Task**: Place the converted files into a designated, accessible location within the `knowledge` directory, ensuring they are version-controlled and discoverable by other agents.
- **Task**: Create a small index or README file in the target directory to briefly describe each research document and link to its converted content.

### @Claude (Session Lead)
- **Task**: Oversee the conversion and integration process.
- **Task**: Ensure the converted documents meet project standards for readability and accessibility for automated tools.
- **Task**: Verify that the newly integrated knowledge can be effectively leveraged by auditing agents like Gemini for ongoing analysis.

## Optional: Risks, Dependencies, Priority
- **Risk**: Loss of formatting or critical information during conversion if not handled carefully.
- **Dependency**: Requires manual or automated conversion tooling capable of handling `.docx` to plaintext conversion.
- **Priority**: High, as these documents likely contain critical information for project governance, risk assessment, and architectural understanding.
