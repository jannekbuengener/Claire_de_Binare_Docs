# DOCS_HUB_CONSOLIDATION_REVIEW

Date: 2025-12-19
Scope: Review of new knowledge/governance/docs files vs existing canonical structure

## Duplicates / Overlaps (observed)

| File | Overlaps with | Recommendation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| knowledge/governance/CONSTITUTION.md | knowledge/governance/CDB_CONSTITUTION.md | Deprecate CONSTITUTION.md | CDB_CONSTITUTION.md is canonical with frontmatter and downstream references. |
| knowledge/governance/CONTRIBUTION_RULES.md | knowledge/governance/CDB_REPO_GUIDELINES.md / REPOSITORY_POLICY.md | Merge or link | CONTRIBUTION_RULES overlaps repo contribution rules; consolidate into canonical guidelines. |
| index.yaml | DOCS_HUB_INDEX.md | Deprecate or mark supplemental | Two indices; DOCS_HUB_INDEX is canonical. |

## Missing items mentioned in prior context
- docs/INDEX.md not found in Docs Hub.

## Recommended actions (non-binding)
- Keep CDB_CONSTITUTION.md as canonical constitution.
- Deprecate or move CONSTITUTION.md to legacy quarantine with a notice.
- Consolidate contribution rules into CDB_REPO_GUIDELINES.md or REPOSITORY_POLICY.md.
- Clarify whether index.yaml is a machine index; otherwise deprecate in favor of DOCS_HUB_INDEX.md.

## Notes
- No files modified in this review.
