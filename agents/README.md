# Agent Definitions

**This directory provides an overview of the AI agents operating within the Claire de Binare ecosystem.**

## Canonical Source

The canonical, version-controlled definitions for agent prompts, roles, and charters are located in the `.cdb_local/agents` directory at the root of the workspace. This directory serves as the single source of truth.

The files in this directory (`/agents`) provide a high-level summary and link to the canonical definitions. They are intended for quick reference and to describe the agent's role in the context of the Docs Hub.

Do not modify agent behavior here. All changes to agent instructions or roles must be made in the `.cdb_local/agents` directory.
