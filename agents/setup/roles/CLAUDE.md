# CLAUDE — Pointer to Canonical Role File

⚠️ **THIS IS A POINTER FILE — NOT THE CANONICAL DEFINITION**

## Canonical Location

The authoritative CLAUDE role definition is located at:

```
C:\Users\janne\Documents\GitHub\Workspaces\Claire_de_Binare_Docs\agents\CLAUDE.md
```

## Why This Pointer Exists

- **setup/roles/**: Legacy path for compatibility
- **agents/**: Single source of truth for role definitions

**ALL AGENTS MUST LOAD FROM `agents/CLAUDE.md`**, not from this file.

**For the full canonical role definition, refer to:**
`../../CLAUDE.md`
