# Agent Role Standardization and Blueprint Framework

## Management Summary
• Standardized agent template with clear mission, responsibilities, and boundaries
• Structured input/output definitions for consistent agent collaboration
• Strict boundary enforcement preventing unauthorized system modifications
• Startup sequence standardization for reliable agent initialization
• Failure mode handling with explicit uncertainty and risk marking protocols
• Role-based access control preventing direct deployments or API calls
• Clear collaboration patterns between specialized agent roles
• Governance-aligned boundary definitions for safe agent operations

## Decision Questions
1. Should all existing agents be migrated to the new blueprint standard immediately?
2. What approval process is required for creating new agent roles?
3. How do we enforce boundary compliance across all agent implementations?
4. What monitoring and audit mechanisms ensure agents stay within defined roles?
5. Should we implement automated agent performance evaluation based on blueprint adherence?
