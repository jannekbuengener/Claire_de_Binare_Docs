# Specific policies governing agent behavior.

## Where to write / Where not to write
*   **Write here:** Policies, rules, and constraints that specifically apply to agents, elaborating on `CDB_AGENT_POLICY.md`.
*   **Do NOT write here:** General governance policies (use `governance/`), agent role definitions (use `agents/roles/`).

## Key entrypoints
*   [CDB Agent Policy (conceptual link to governance/CDB_AGENT_POLICY.md)](../governance/CDB_AGENT_POLICY.md)
