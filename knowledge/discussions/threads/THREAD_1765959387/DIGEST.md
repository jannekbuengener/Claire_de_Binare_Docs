## Proposal Summary

**Topic:** Mathematical framework selection for dynamic risk modeling system

**Question:** BSDE (Backward Stochastic Differential Equations) vs. Classical Stochastic Control (HJB-based approach)

**Context:**
- Both theoretically equivalent via Pontryagin's Maximum Principle
- Major differences in: numerical treatment, scalability, implementation
- Strategic decision with long-term consequences for Q1/Q2 2025

## Agent Analysis

### Claude (Sonnet 4.5) - Confidence: 77%

**Recommendation:** **Hybrid approach** - HJB baseline + BSDE research track

**Key Arguments:**

1. **Dimensionality Drives Choice:**
   - d ≤ 10: HJB dominates (mature tooling, interpretable)
   - d > 20: BSDE becomes competitive
   - d > 50: BSDE is only tractable option

2. **Production-Readiness Gap:**
   - BSDE: Research prototypes, immature ecosystem, 2-3x dev time
   - HJB: Battle-tested libraries (scipy, FEniCS), decades of PDE experience

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Pure BSDE: Too risky for 2025 timeline (40% chance solver doesn't converge)
   - Pure HJB: May struggle if dimensionality exceeds d=10
   - Hybrid: De-risks decision, provides fallback

4. **Team Expertise:**
   - HJB: Needs 0-1 PDE expert
   - BSDE: Needs 1-2 ML engineers + 1 stochastic calculus expert
   - Cost: BSDE requires 2x headcount + 6-12 months ramp-up

**Concrete Next Steps:**

**Week 1-2:** Dimensionality audit
- Map risk model components to state variables
- Identify natural decompositions (can 50d → 5×10d?)
- Establish minimum required d

**Week 3-4:** Prototype shootout
- Implement toy problem (3D Black-Scholes) in both frameworks
- Compare accuracy, speed, code complexity, debuggability
- Document what broke vs. what worked

**Week 5-6:** Architecture decision
- Review prototype results
- Go/No-Go on BSDE investment
- Finalize routing logic (when to use which solver)

**Q2 2025:** Production implementation
- Build HJB baseline (4 weeks)
- Validate on historical data (2 weeks)
- Deploy to shadow mode (2 weeks)
- Optional: Add BSDE layer in parallel

## Quality Metrics

**Disagreement Count:** 0 (single agent)
**Echo Chamber Score:** 0.0 (N/A for single agent)
**Confidence:** 77% (Good, but not excellent)

**Verdict:** GOOD

**Why not EXCELLENT?**
- Unknowns: Actual dimensionality of production system (±20%)
- Unknowns: Team capacity for BSDE complexity (±15%)
- Could reach 90%+ after dimensionality audit + prototype shootout

---

## Gate Status: **TRIGGERED**

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Explicit flag: `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` in output
2. ✅ Strategic keywords: "High organizational impact" detected

**Human Decision Required:**
- Strategic technical direction (affects Q1/Q2 2025 deliverables)
- Team hiring implications (0-1 vs. 2-3 new hires)
- Budget allocation (HJB baseline vs. BSDE research track)

## Critical Insights

**The theoretical equivalence is misleading for production systems.**

- Mathematical elegance ≠ production readiness
- BSDE literature is impressive but ecosystem is immature
- HJB is "boring" but battle-tested
- Decision should be driven by: team expertise, maintainability, incremental risk

**Don't solve the general d=100 problem if your actual system is d=8.**

- Many high-dimensional problems have natural decompositions
- Dimensionality audit (Week 1-2) is critical first step
- May discover problem is actually tractable with HJB after all

**Hybrid approach provides optionality without paralysis.**

- Q1: Working HJB baseline (de-risks timeline)
- Q2: Optional BSDE layer (if dimensionality forces it)
- Team learns both approaches in parallel
- Can pivot based on empirical results

---

## Literature Gaps Identified

**Missing from current research:**
1. Empirical BSDE vs. HJB comparison on real financial datasets (not synthetic)
2. Production deployment case studies for Deep BSDE (Han et al. is academic)
3. Error bounds for BSDE in non-asymptotic regimes
4. Debugging tools for neural PDE solvers

**Opportunity:** Publish your benchmark results from prototype shootout

---

## Recommended Action

**✅ PROCEED** to dimensionality audit (Week 1-2) and prototype shootout (Week 3-4)

**Then reconvene for architecture decision (Week 5-6) with empirical data**

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Commit to pure BSDE without prototyping (too risky)
- ❌ Wait indefinitely for "more research" (decision paralysis)
- ❌ Ignore team expertise constraints (hiring takes time)

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Human review:** Evaluate recommendation + risk assessment
2. **Decision:** PROCEED / REVISE / REJECT
3. **If approved:** Create GitHub issue with action items
4. **If rejected:** Document rationale for future reference
